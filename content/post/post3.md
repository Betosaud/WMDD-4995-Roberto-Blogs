### It always happens when you most need your creativity
It's Murphy's Law being merceless. Suddenly, your mental process stops. You seem to have lost concentration; you have no idea what to create. The monkeys in your brain do everything but focus. It's scary, especially when you're in the middle of writing a long assignment and seem to have hit an insurmountable spot. Do not worry - you're not alone. Almost every serious creative professional has already dealt with this problem and has come out stronger on the other side. Here are a collection of steps that help me in a simple (but not infallible) way of overcoming creative blockage.

#### Write everything you think
Accept that you have a creative block. When this happens, no idea comes to mind and your writing packs. Understand that creative blocking is easy to overcome and there are many ways to do this. Do not hesitate to write the idea that you will never have again. Specially for designers, this method involves researching another peoples materials and taking reference (lots of) from their jobs.

#### Be a good observer
Creativity is making connections. Sometimes you ask a creative how he did something and he feels it even feels bad - that's because, deep down, he just connected the dots.
That's where the success of the "always walk with a notebook" (or Evernote on the smartphone) comes in handy, so you can catalog all your curious and creative thoughts / facts of your day with precision / details that you do not you will have to try to record your head. I personally use Google Keep to write my thoughts.

And it's okay if you never use it directly in a project: the important thing is to tell your brain that creativity and innovation are part of your daily life!

#### Work in various places

The variation of environments stimulates the brain (something that the routine does not do).
My creative tip: If you can't leave your place, go to Youtube and search for "sounds creativity", or simulate the sound of a cafeteria using the Coffitivity website.
I do not recommend listening to music because they always take your attention (even if for a second) - which is enough to ruin a creative flow.

#### Procrastinate a little bit
A little procrastination allows you to leave your brain free to find a solution later.
In addition, rest also helps you find (and understand) the balance between work and rest.
But that's what I meant by "a little bit". it's not playing around for another week or month! You can use X minutes of full focus interspersed with Y minutes of total freedom. For me, what works best is take X as 50 and Y as 10 or 15 minutes.

#### Exercise

It is well known that exercise do wonders for us. Allegedly exercise produces endorphins, promotes better mood and positive thinking, taking you to a sensation of less stress and anxiety.
Physical activity improves our general mental health, so here is what I do on a daily basis:
* look for excuses to exercise, like work standing up for a bit
* climb the stairs instead of using elevators
* go places walking
* do not leave everything you want on the table and etc...

#### Schedule your duties
The idea of creative chaos is cool, but chaos does not let us have peace!
If you wake up knowing you have N things to do, these things will stay there in your subconscious speaking "ow, you still have X; Beware of time and time ... "
When you write things down somewhere (or set an alarm), it's clear to your brain that he does not have to worry about time to do X and Y.
Put your ideas on paper without worrying about whether they sound good.
The result does not have to be pleasant; many writers have creative block because they care about the quality of what they write. Remember that no one but you needs to see what you have written. You can show this to the world when you're ready.

#### Wake up early
Some research indicates that our peak of creativity is in the morning - but I just inserted this tip here to make an appeal: We need to stop with that fire in the ass that creative are better at night. This is as ridiculous as "designer has to use Mac" or "have to use Corel".
The fact is that few people have a biological need to change it day by night - and I doubt all of them are just taking graphic design. In addition, the practice does very bad health, since your body needs to combine sleep + total darkness to produce a series of vital hormones.

#### And finally...Know when to give up on an idea.
Examine what you wrote and ask yourself, "Does this seem to be leading to anything?" If you feel you are going nowhere, then it may be time to leave that idea behind.
I've let clients go because I could not get an agreement with him, even knowing that I was making a good job... It happens. Carry on :)
