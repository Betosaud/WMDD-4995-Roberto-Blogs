### You are a human beign (you are, right?)
A logos designer needs to know that no matter how many amazing logos he has already created, he is still a human being and it means that at least once in his life he/she must have made a mistake. 

The vast majority of errors can be corrected. But how is it possible to "fix" a wrong logo? Unfortunately, there are some fields of activity where errors are impossible to correct and believe it or not, logo design seems to be one of them.
A logo is part of a branding strategy, which means people will make a simple judgment: a bad logo represents a bad entity. That is, a badly designed logo is a highway to go bankrupt.

On the other hand, logo designers are put under pressure, also known as "the best context for making mistakes". It's a vicious circle and you need to be cold-blooded to escape it. Generally, less experienced designers make the most mistakes, but it is not impossible to conceive that even the most experienced can create poor logos. But how to avoid this?

In the world of graphic design, there are two types of bad logos:
Irremediable logos - these are extremely bad logos or contain misspelled words, impossible color combinations, or Comic Sans type fonts :)
Poor Logos - These are the logos that have a small mistake. Usually, only designers notice these details while they go unnoticed by customers.


The truth is that there is no 100% effective way in which you can be absolutely sure that your logo is perfect but there are solutions to have good feedback on your project.
Among the solutions to avoid the bad logo, is to pass it through a checklist before sending to the customer. This checklist should answer some standard questions (does it work in small size? Does it work if printed in B & W?).
Checking your logo before shipping to the customer can result in a greater investment of development time, but this decreases the chances of spending more time in the future with unnecessary changes.
I've collect some common errors of a logo designer that can represent the fundamentals of your checklist.

### Making "inflexible"
The logo designer must respect your customers. In general, the professional should have the courage to explain to their customers when one of their requirements does not respect the rules of good design. Many clients consider that the logo is only required for their website and nothing more, and unfortunately there are some logo designers who believe that too.
One of the most common mistakes of a logos designer is to create logos that are not scalable. It is pointless to mention that Adobe Photoshop is great software, but it has its limitations. Working with vectors is one of its major drawbacks and therefore Photoshop is not the best solution for logo design.
A good alternative is Adobe Illustrator, a software preferred by designers for working with vector images (enabling logo scalability).
The logo is part of a brand strategy and, sooner or later, it will be used in printing. Business cards, flyers, banners are just a few items that require a printed version of a logo. A non-scalable logo will not look good enough either on a small business card or on a huge billboard. So, you should create logos that can be used everywhere.

### Ignore context
A logo is not a separate item that should serve perfectly in the environment where it is placed. Another common mistake of a logo designer is to neglect the other elements of the brand, such as website, culture work, visual identity, etc.
Search (and research) is required - this way you discover the context in which the logo will be inserted. A logo that matches the owner's style is way better than an independent entity.

### Designing for Yourself
Every logo design is very subjective. To be specific, each logo is very subjective and its value can vary depending on each prospect.
Any logo designer should be aware that their preferences should be ignored if they come up against the customer's. Still, a good logo should not be appreciated by the creator and not even by the customer: the value of a logo is given by the appreciation of the viewers.
To create a competitive logo is important to determine the main target and identify your preferences. Any other approach is not applicable and I do not consider that the validity of this concept should be tested in its activity.

### Stealing Forms and Not Ideas
No designer wants to copy the work of another, but sometimes it can happen. It is an amateur error, but it exists and you should not commit it.
Getting inspiration is a very important subject and everyone must "replenish" the level of creativity; one of the most efficient methods is to study the work of other designers. Because of this, it may happen that some designers copy logos (even unintentionally). The problem is this: while wise logo designers "steal" ideas, the mediocre steal shapes or fonts.

You should never try to imitate digital items, just borrow concepts. When studying logos, do not write down shapes or letters, just get the idea and adapt it!

### Ignoring mandatory steps in designing a logo
Each designer has its own creative process, and a process is vital so that some errors are avoided. Incorporating a few check items during the development process decreases the chances of changes after project completion and making the creation process more efficient. Finally, it is easier to predict deadlines and finalize a project.
