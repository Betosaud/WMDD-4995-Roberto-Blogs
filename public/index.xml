      <description>You are a human beign (you are, right?) A logos designer needs to know that no matter how many amazing logos he has already created, he is still a human being and it means that at least once in his life he/she must have made a mistake.

      <description>It always happens when you most need your creativity It&amp;rsquo;s Murphy&amp;rsquo;s Law being merceless. Suddenly, your mental process stops. You seem to have lost concentration; you have no idea what to create. The monkeys in your brain do everything but focus. It&amp;rsquo;s scary, especially when you&amp;rsquo;re in the middle of writing a long assignment and seem to have hit an insurmountable spot. Do not worry - you&amp;rsquo;re not alone. Almost every serious creative professional has already dealt with this problem and has come out stronger on the other side.</description>

      <description>What is it anyway? Mobile first is a concept, a break in patterns, vices, and paradigms that have been acquired over the years. It&amp;rsquo;s a strategy and a different way of looking at content that really matters on a website. Mobile devices are becoming more sophisticated and present in our lives. Even so, they often do not receive due importance during the process of creating and developing our sites. It was in this search for optimization that the mobile first was born: the focus on the user experience in mobile devices.</description>

      <description>My perspective As a well rounded IT professional, I thought it was a good time to try a career change. I always was attracted by the design of things. I always liked to poke around with Photoshop and to be creative. Then I started to study web development and design.
