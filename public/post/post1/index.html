<h2 id="your-website-by-subcription">Your website, by subcription</h2>

<p>In many ways websites are similar to software – which is why we’ve chosen to offer them as a service. The standard way of going about things as a web professional is to design and build a website for a client, deploy it on a host, send them an invoice and move on to your next project. <em>Websites, traditionally, have been a product.</em></p>

<p>Like software, websites are at the mercy of design trends, disruptive innovations, new technology and browser standards for their survival. When they do become obsolete, it’s not uncommon to be charged for a mere upgrade – let alone a whole new site altogether. Owning and maintaining your own site can be expensive, and so can the support and security.</p>

<p><strong>Website as a Service (WaaS)</strong> covers the extensive design, development, maintenance and technical details required to craft an industry-specific and customised website. There are quite an extensive number of elements that complete the (WaaS) package. The service provides everything that you would need to create the perfect web presence for your business. And as a service, it is charged by subscription and it can include:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Design &amp; Branding imagery</strong>: designs, and phrases associated with a brand can help a business gain, and maintain a loyal client.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Colour, Typography and consistency</strong>: The depiction of a brand typically come with subconscious undertones from the perspective of the consumer.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>SEO Readiness</strong>:
With WaaS, your website’s Search Engine Optimisation (SEO) will be updated on an on-going basis. There are certain strategic aspects of SEO that should be incorporated right from the start when developing a website in order to create a successful SEO and online campaign.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Maintenance</strong>:
The Website as a Service model allows for regular maintenance and updates to be included in the overall package.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Website Hosting</strong>:
The foundation of a website lies in the server that it will be hosted on. Our Website as a Service model boasts Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud hosting as our partner. AWS offers secure, reliable services to a multitude of clientele including Expedia, Unilever, Airbnb, and many other large companies.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Thanks to the cloud, the last five years have seen the ‘Software as a service’ (SAAS) movement rapidly picking up momentum. The core principals of doing business like this are: Constant development and improvement, quick support and training, Major investment in risk management, Great return on investment for users.</p>

<p>Alternatively, by paying a subscription fee (which can be cancelled at any time) and receiving the updates for no extra cost, users don’t end up forking out anywhere near as much overall for top of the line software.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="break-down-the-benefits">Break down the benefits</h2>

<p>Now, working as a free lancer in Vancouver - BC, I can say by experience that some companies could really benefit from this business model. All in all, this is a far better way to provide websites – and here is why, wraping everything up:</p>

<ul>
<li>Your website won&rsquo;t have an expiry date.</li>
<li>Your site will be as modern and trendy as possible.</li>
<li>Clients can focus on their content and outsource the support and maintenance.</li>
<li>Flexibily and agility.</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
<p><em>The whole point of having a website is that you can put your products and services online to gain new leads and convert new business. If you decide to add a new marketing push, promote a sale, or list a new product or service, some website design companies make it very hard to accomplish.</em></p>
